# 15ml falcon tube cyclone filter
Cyclone filters function by particle separation from a fluid by centrifugal forces and gravity, which is beneficial for continuous filtration where filter components are difficult to exchange and potential clogging could reduce flow rates. This filter design is adapted for laboratory applications using peristaltic pumps and connects to 15ml falcon tubes that act as particle collectors.

## Required components list
- 15ml-falcon-hydrocyclone-filter.stl
- 1x o-ring seal, 14.5x1.5mm - to seal between the filter and the falcon tube at the tubing top
- 1x o-ring seal, 11x1.3mm - to displace liquid from the top part of the falcon tube
- 2x o-ring seal, 4x1mm - seal between the filer and tubing connectors
- 2x tubing connectors with M5 threading

## Assembly and usage
the attached stl files can be manufactured by SLA/DLP resin printing. For biomedical research applications the used resin should be non-toxic. Cleaning and sterilisation of the filter should be performed according to resin specifications.
The 3D printed filter components are assembled by placing the o-rings and using the filter to screw onto a 15ml falcon tube. Insert tubing connectors with M5 screws and seal them using o-rings.
