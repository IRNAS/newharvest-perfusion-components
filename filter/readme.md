# Cyclone filter
Cyclone filters function by particle separation from a fluid by centrifugal forces and gravity, which is beneficial for continuous filtration where filter components are difficult to exchange and potential clogging could reduce flow rates. This filter design is adapted for laboratory applications using peristaltic pumps and flow rates in the range of 1-100ml/min to particles abradded from tubing.

## File descriptions
- main-chamber.stl (conical chamber where the separatory vortex is formed, forcing particles in the suspension against the outer wall and downwards towar the particle colletor)
- base-storage.stl (particle collector - here the particles removed from the suspension are accumulated during perfusion)
- outlet-A.stl (filter cover, formed to direct flow into a conical shape directed towards the bottom and exiting through the vertical channel upwards)

## Required components list
- base-storage.stl
- main-chamber.stl
- outlet-A.stl
- 2x o-ring seal, 10x1.5mm
- 3x M3 threaded bolt
- 3x M3 threaded nut
- silicone tubing with 1.5mm internal diameter
## Assembly and usage
the attached stl files can be manufactured by SLA/DLP resin printing. For biomedical research applications the used resin should be non-toxic. Cleaning and sterilisation of the filter should be performed according to resin specifications.

The 3D printed filter components are assembled from top to bottom: outlet-A -> main-chamber -> base-storage by placing o-ring seals between each pair. The connections are fastened using M3 threaded nuts and bolts. The filter is placed so that the base-storage component is lying flat on the bottom. Flow direction needs to be from the lateral input (main-chamber) to the top output (outlet-A).
