# Cyclone filter

Cyclone filters function by particle separation from a fluid by centrifugal forces and gravity, which is beneficial for continuous filtration where filter components are difficult to exchange and potential clogging could reduce flow rates. This filter design is adapted for laboratory applications using peristaltic pumps and flow rates in the range of 1-100ml/min to particles abradded from tubing.
